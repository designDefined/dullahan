# React Component Rules

## Component Structure

- All components should be function components
- Use named exports for all components except Next.js page or layout components
- Page and layout components should use default exports (Next.js convention)

## Component Naming

- Use PascalCase for component names
- Use descriptive, semantic names that indicate the component's purpose
- Avoid generic names like "Component" or "Wrapper" unless absolutely necessary

## File Structure

- All component shuold located in each workspace's `src/components`, unless it is specifal NextJS component that shuold be located in app.
- Component used only in specific route locates in `src/components/{topic-of-route}` directory. Topic-of-route doesn't neccessarily follow the name of route, such as `articles` and `article`. Singular is better since it's more topic-like.
- Component used across the pages locaets in `src/components/_common`. Those are components like Header or Footer.
- Shadcn components are located in `src/components/_ui`.
- Component file should located in subdirectory that has same name with component. And the file name is always `index.tsx`. Except NextJS components in app directory.

## Example

```tsx
// ✅ Good - Named export for regular components
export function Button({ children, ...props }) {
  return <button {...props}>{children}</button>;
}

// ✅ Good - Default export for Next.js pages
export default function Page() {
  return <div>Page content</div>;
}
```
