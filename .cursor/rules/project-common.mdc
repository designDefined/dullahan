# Project Guide (Common)

This document outlines the overall structure and convention of this project.

## Package manager

This project uses yarn for pacakge manager and mono-repo organizer. Always use `yarn` instead of `npm` to manipulate dependencies or run commands.

Use `yarn add` to install packages. Use root `package.json`'s workspace alias to install pacakge in workspace-specific context.

```bash
# Install shared pacakge
yarn add react

# Install workspace-specific package (ex. strapi-head)
yarn strapi-head add react
```
